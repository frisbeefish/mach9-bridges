# mach9-bridges

This is the code for a map that shows bridges across the USA and their status.

# Data Model

This is just a "toy" data model, but it shows how we've currently stored data in the system so that
we can perform various queries to determine things such as:

- Bridges within a county.
- Populations of each county.
- Highway districts and which bridges they are responisible for.
- Which routes contain which bridges.
- Etc.
